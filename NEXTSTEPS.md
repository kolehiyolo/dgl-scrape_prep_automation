1. Next steps are obviously to fix the remaining issues
  1.1. There are actually 2 rows of headers, not just one, and row 1 should be the column group titles, and row 2 the actual column names
  1.2. The hours, for some reason, are being rendered into the output as "7â€¯AM to 5â€¯PM", for example, when I know for a fact that the input is simply "7 AM to 5 PM"
2. I also still need to make the input/output situation easier, as initially planned
