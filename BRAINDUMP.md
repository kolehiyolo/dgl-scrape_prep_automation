IO improved very slightly

1. Yeah IO isn't perfect, all I did was just have variables for file names and shit so that I just have to edit the variable init value once per input file
2. The scraper's working awesomely tho, despite the setbacks, but a lot of grunt work still needed to be done in Google Sheets
3. Unless I find a way to integrate Python with Google Sheets, I won't be able to automate the process entirely, which is the eventual goal
  3.1. This is definitely an interesting avenue to take, esp since I already have exp using Google Apps Script
4. For now, this project is done, and to be revisited for review when I get the time, or when I am in need of the script for scrapes
5. I will be removing the IOs for privacy reasons
