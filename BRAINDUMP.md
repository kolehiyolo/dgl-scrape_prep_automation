Group title adding not working, to revisit

1. I give up
2. I've been trying with ChatGPT to just simply add the damned group titles respective of the column titles, but damn I guess the GPT-4 to GPT-3 transition really makes it that much dumber
3. We've just been going around in circles and some point it even just hallucinated into just telling me my code is good when what I wanted was revisions and not just advise, AND IT'S THEIR CODE IN THE FIRST PLACE NOT MINE LOL
4. It's my fault too cuz I'm just mostly copy-pasting for now, but that's because I'm very much strapped for time and I just want a working script ASAP so I can process the data and send it ASAP to my boss lol
5. Either way, I give up on this for now, and will fix the second issue, namely the weird rendering of the hours
